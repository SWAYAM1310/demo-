THIS IS MY FIRST JUMP TO GIT REPOSITORY
<br>
WHEN WE MODIFY OUR FILE there's a two step process:
<br>
first we add and then commit.
<br>

THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF GIT STATUS:
<br>

1. untracked : new files git doesn't track
<br>

2. modified : changed <br>

3. staged : file is ready to be committed

4. unmodified : unchanged
